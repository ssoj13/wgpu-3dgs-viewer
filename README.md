## Overview

This library displays 3D Gaussian Splatting models with wgpu. It includes a ready‑to‑use pipeline and modular pieces you can swap out.

- Rendering pipeline
  - Preprocess: cull off‑screen points and set up indirect draw data.
  - Sort and draw: sort by depth and draw the Gaussians.
  - Modes: Gaussians may be displayed as splat, ellipse, or point.
  - Transforms: apply model or per-Gaussian transforms.
- Abstraction for renderer and buffers
  - Viewer: one type that manages the buffers and pipelines.
  - Low-level access: preprocessor, sorter, renderer, and their buffers can be used separately.
  - Supports PLY and SPZ file formats.
  - GPU buffer allows for compressed and uncompressed formats.
- Optional features
  - Multi-model: render many models with custom draw orders.
  - Selection: viewport selection (e.g. rectangle, brush) that marks Gaussians for editing.
- Shaders
  - WGSL shaders packaged with WESL, you can extend or replace them.

## Usage

You may read the documentation of the following types for more details:

- [`Viewer`]: Manages buffers and renders a model.
  - [`Preprocessor`]: Culls Gaussians and fills indirect args and depths.
  - [`RadixSorter`]: Sorts Gaussians by depth on the GPU.
  - [`Renderer`]: Draws Gaussians with the selected display mode.
- [`MultiModelViewer`]: [`Viewer`] equivalent for multiple models. Requires `multi-model` feature.
- [`selection`]: Select Gaussians based on viewport interactions, e.g. rectangle or brush. Requires `selection` feature.

> [!TIP]
>
> The design principles of this crate are to provide modularity and flexibility to the end user of the API, which means exposing low-level WebGPU APIs. However, this means that you have to take care of your code when accessing low-level components. You risk breaking things at run-time if you don't handle them properly.
>
> If you do not want to take the risk, consider using the higher-level wrappers and avoid any instances of passing `wgpu` types into functions.

### Simple Viewer

You can use [`Viewer`] to render a single 3D Gaussian Splatting model:

```rust ignore
use wgpu_3dgs_viewer as gs;
use wgpu_3dgs_viewer::core::glam::UVec2;

// Setup wgpu...

// Read the Gaussians from the .ply file
let gaussians = gs::core::Gaussians::read_from_file(model_path, gs::core::GaussiansSource::Ply)
    .expect("gaussians");

// Create the camera
let camera = gs::Camera::new(0.1..1e4, 60f32.to_radians());

// Create the viewer
let mut viewer = gs::Viewer::new(&device, config.view_formats[0], &gaussians).expect("viewer");

// Setup camera parameters...

// Update the viewer's camera buffer
viewer.update_camera(
    &queue,
    &camera,
    UVec2::new(config.width, config.height),
);

// Create wgpu command encoder...

// Render the model
viewer.render(&mut encoder, &texture_view);
```
